Hi all, I am Harsh Tripathi, currently pursuing computer science and engeenering from IIIT Nagpur. I was scrolling the list of organizations for GSOC when I came across Lpython, what mesmerized me was that you guys are working on compiler for python. Since the first language I learnt was python and I also have good c++ and OOP skills, the project idea "Implement modules from the Python standard library" piqued my interest. I Hope that with your mentorship I will be able to apply my programming skills to implment the idea and make Lpython more user accessible and popular.
