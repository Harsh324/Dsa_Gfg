## Count Occurences in a sorted array

    ** Given a sorted array which might contain duplicates
       also given a number X, tak is to find number of 
       occurences of X


    I/P : Arr[] = {10, 20, 20, 20, 30, 30}, X = 20;
    O/P : 3

    I/P : Arr[] = {10, 10, 10, 10, 10}, X = 10;
    O/P : 5

    I/P : Arr[] = {5, 8, 10}, X = 7;
    O/P : 0

    

    ** Naive appproach could be traversing array linearly
       and counting all the occurence of X.

    Approach 1 :


    ** Better solution
    ** We will be using two functions discussed in "Searching_problems.txt" file


    Approach 2 :

        int Count_Occurence(int Arr[], int int Len, int X)
        {
            int First = First_Ind(Arr, Len, X)

            if(First == -1)
                return 0;
            
            else
                return(Last_Ind(Arr, Len, X) - First + 1);
        }
