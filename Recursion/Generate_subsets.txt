## Generate subsets 

    # Given a string of length N, task is to generate,
      all subsets of the given string.
      Assume that all the characters in the string are distinct.


    I/P : Str = "AB" ;
    O/P : "" "A" "B" "C" ;

    I/P : Str = "ABC" ;
    O/P : "" "A" "B" "C" "AB" "AC" "BC" "ABC" ;
    

    ** For a string of length N there is going to be 2^N subsets,
       or subsequnces.
    ** This problem can be seen as generating all subsequnce of,
       the string, a subsequnce is obtained by removing 0 or,
       more characters from the given string.


    ## Recursive program for the problem

    void Subs(string Str, string Char = "", int Ind = 0)
    {
        if(Ind == Str.length())
        {
            cout<<Char<<" ";
            return;
        }
        Subs(Str, Char, Ind + 1);
        Subs(Str, Char + Str[Ind] , Ind + 1);
    }
