## Binary Heap

    ** Used in heap sort.
    ** used to implement priority queue
        ** priority queue is used in dijikstra, prims, huffman algorithm
    ** Two ways to do so

        ** Min Heap
            Highest priority itme is assigned lowest value
        ** Max Heap
            Highest priority item is assigned highest value

    ** Binary heap is a complete binary tree (stored as an array) this is the olny reason.

    ** Binary tree is called complete if its all levels all completely filed,
       except the last level and the last level is to be filled from left to right only.

    ** Left(i) = 2i + 1, Right(i) = 2i + 2, Parent(i)
