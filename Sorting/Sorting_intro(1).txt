## Stability in Sorting algorithm

    ** Given ann array already lexicographicly sorted,
    by name. we want to sort as per scores, if equal,
    then alphbetical


    Arr[] = [("Anil, 50), ("Ayan", 80), ("Piyush", 50), ("Ramesh", 80)]

    After sorting(Stable)

    Arr[] = [("Anil, 50), ("Piyush", 50), ("Ayan", 80), ("Ramesh", 80)]

    ** Array of object need stable sorting 



    ## Stable Sort methods

        Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort etc

    ## Unstable Sort methods

        Selection sort, Quick sort, Heap sort etc
