## Selection sort 

    ** Basic comparison based algorithm, take Theta(N^2) time,
    int all cases.

    ** Take less memory writes compared to Quick , Merge , Insertion sort,
    etc. However Cycle sort is better in memeory write.

    ** It is basic idea for Heap sort

    ** It is not stable algorithm, Inplace algorithm


    ** Basic idea is Find minimu eellemnt, put at first postion,
    Find second minmum put at 


// Call by value
int Increment(int Num)
{
    return Num++;
}

// Call bye reference
void Swap(int* A, int* B)
{
    int Temp;
    Temp = *A;
    *A = *B;
    *B = Temp;
}
