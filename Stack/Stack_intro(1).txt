## Applications of the Stack.

    (1). Function Calls
    (2). Checking for Balanced Parenthesis
    (3). Reversing Items
    (4). Infix to Prefix/Postfix.
    (5). Evaluation of Postfix/Prefix
    (6). Stock span problems and its variations.
    (7). Undo/Redo or Forward/Backward.




## Stack in STL in C++

    ** Class Stack in STL.

    ## Using Stack in C++


        #include <iostream>
        #include <stack>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            stack<int> s;
            s.push(10);
            s.push(20);
            s.push(30);
            cout<<s.size()<<endl;
            cout<<s.top()<<endl;
            s.pop();
            cout<<s.top()<<endl;
            s.push(5);
            cout<<s.top()<<endl;
            
            while(s.empty() == false)
            {
                cout<<s.top()<<endl;
                s.pop();
            }
            return 0; 
        }

    ## Operations like Push, Pop, Top, Size, Empty all are O(1)

    ## Internal working of stack

        ** It can be implemented on any underlying contianer that,
           provides following operations

           1. Back()
           2. Size()
           3. Empty()
           4. Push_back()
           5. Pop_back() 
            
        ** List, Vector and deque provides all these operations.

    ## Also known as container adapter as they are built on other,
      container and work as interface.
